#W2D4 -HW/Lab - React ToDo

The Todo List Application is a simple React JS application.

The app accepts an input that allows the user to enter a new item to the to do list.
When the user submits the form (presses enter) the value in the input should be added as an item on user's to do list.
The app uses React-icons to update/remove item when it is completed.
